# Digify

Digify aims to take our listening history, from Spotify, and display that history into an easy to read graph using the D3 library. I also used Scroll Magic to create a more modern design for the site itself. The project is built completely on the front-end side. Currently, the data can only search and compare the top 20 artists in each genre. For the future, I will be working on getting Spotify Users authenticated and getting the data necessary to display.

## Getting Started

Simply scroll down and type in a genre of your choice. During the time of this project (March 2017), there was a disccrepancy within the Pop Genre. Ed Sheeran had taken the lead in popularity but his follower count did not reflect this at all.

### Prerequisites

No need to install anything.
